# Light Modeling of the “El Gordo” Galaxy Cluster
##### [Presented at AAS235](https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/8993/presentation/2011)

#### This repository contains an ascii format catalog of best-fit parameters for 
#### the 89 galaxies spectroscopically confirmed [1] as members of the galaxy
#### cluster ACT-CL-J0102-49151, “El Gordo” [2] as seen in 10 Hubble Space 
#### Telescope filters. Wide Field Camera 3 filters, F105W, F125W, F140W, and
#### F160W were used, as well as the filters F435W, F606W, F625W, F775W, F814W,
#### and F850LP from the Advanced Camera for Surveys. 
#### Additionally catalogs, per filter, of small, low-mass galaxies detected after   
#### subtraction of the previously mentioned best-fit model are contained here,
#### also in ascii format. All column names reference SExtractor [3] parameters
#### with descriptions available in that software's manual.
